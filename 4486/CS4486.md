* Three questions in the final exam:

  * Fuzzy logic
  * Evolution Computing
  * Artificial Neural Network

* Fuzzy Logic System

  * Fuzzy: Blur, not clear, ambiguity

  * Fuzzy Logic => How to define “fast”? - One useful definition is using a membership function ranges from 0-1, with a larger value indicating a higher **degree of truth**

  * Fuzzy Logic System => For example, a temperature control system for bath-tub. 

    * If $x$(error temp) is $A$(small hot), then $y$(action opening) is $B$(small large)

    * small hot and small large are two membership functions, for example, hot might be defined as:

    * Fuzzy system is *a convenient way* to map an **input space** to an **output space**, for e.g.: 

      * Present Condition => Knowledge Inference (If...then...) => Conclusion
      * Service Quality => Black Box => The “right” tips

    * What could go into the Black Box

      * Mathematic model

    * Fuzzy Washing Machine: (Deg_of_Dirt, Type_of_dirt) => Wash time

    * A ‘Simple’ Control System: Driving a car from point A to point B, control the car

      * A set of control rules: 
        * **Deviation** is zero, **turn** is zero
        * **Deviation** is positive, **turn** is negative
        * **Deviation** is negative, **turn** is positive
      * Deviation => Fuzzy Inference => Turn

## Lecture02: Fuzzy Set & Fuzzy Logic

### Fuzzy Set

* Crisp Sets and Fuzzy Sets

  * Crisp sets(Such as binary sets): Variables are either true or false(to be in the set)
  *  $X$: The universe of discourse (universal set)
  * $A=\{a_1,a_2,...,a_n\}$: A set whose elements are $a_1,a_2,...,a_n$.
  * $|A|$: Number of elements in the set $A$
  * $P(A)$: Power set of $A$, contains all possible subsets of $A$
  * $|P(A)|=2^{|A|}$ 

* Mapping of Crisp Sets to Functions(Membership function of crisp sets): Characteristic function:
  $$
  \chi_A(x)=\left\{
  \begin{aligned}
  1\ (iff\ \ x\in A)\\
  0\ (iff\ \ x\notin A)\\
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
  $$

* Basics of Fuzzy Sets: 

  * Fuzzy set theory uses linguistic variables, rather than quantitative variables, to represent imprecise concepts

  * Need to represent the concept such as “hot” so that machine can communicate with humans 

  * How strongly do you agree that a give number is a “hot” temperature (belongs to the hot set)

    * Threshold type: 

      ![1581494797127](CS4486.assets/1581494797127.png)

    * Conservative type:

      ![1581494808101](CS4486.assets/1581494808101.png)

    * Compromiser type:

      ![1581494816144](CS4486.assets/1581494816144.png)

  * **Fuzzy set**: A set $A$ containing elements that have varying degrees of membership in the set, which defined by a membership function $\mu_A$ 

  * **Membership function**: A function $\mu_A:X\mapsto[0,1]$ (compared to $\chi_A: X\mapsto\{0,1\}$)

    * Larger value of membership function denotes higher degree of the membership
    * Each function corresponds to an *adj.* intuitively
    * Each function defines a fuzzy set
    * Membership function actually depends on the definition, it may not be symmetric

    ![1581495932401](CS4486.assets/1581495932401.png)

* Different Membership Functions

  * A possible membership function

    ![1581496088167](CS4486.assets/1581496088167.png)

  * Triangular membership function (three parameters $a,b,c$)

    ![1581496096507](CS4486.assets/1581496096507.png)

  * Trapezoidal membership function (four parameters $a,b,c,d$)

    ![1581496115186](CS4486.assets/1581496115186.png)

* Representation of Fuzzy Sets

  * Fuzzy set $A$ for a **discrete and finite** universe of discourse $X$ is
    $$
    A = \mu_A(x_1)/x_1 + \mu_A(x_2)/x_2 + ... + \mu_A(x_n)/x_n \\
    =\sum_{i=1}^n\mu_A(x_i)/x_i \\
    $$

    * Notice that in here the meaning of $/$ is not division and $+$ is not addition $\sum$ is not summation
    * $x_i > 0$

  * For **continuous and infinite** is: $A=\int_x\mu_A(x)/x$ 

  * E.g. $A=0.5/20+1/30+0.5/40$ 

    ![1581496436449](CS4486.assets/1581496436449.png)

* Relative definitions of fuzzy set: 

  ![1581497282593](CS4486.assets/1581497282593.png)

  * **Height** of a fuzzy set: the maximum value of the membership
    $$
    hgt(A) = \underline {sup}reme\{x\in X|\mu_A(x)\}=sup\{x\in X|\mu_A(x)\}=max\{x\in X|\mu_A(x)\}
    $$

  * **Support** of a fuzzy set $A$: The **crisp set** of all $x\in X$ such that $\mu_A(x) > 0$
    $$
    Supp(A) = \{x\in X | \mu_A(x)>0\}
    $$

  * **Core** of a fuzzy set $A$: The **crisp set** of all $x\in X$ such that $\mu_A(x) = 1$
    $$
    Core(A) = \{x\in X | \mu_A(x)=1\}
    $$

  * **$\alpha$-cut** of a fuzzy set $A$: A crisp set $A_\alpha$ that contains all the elements of the universal set $X$ that have a membership grade in $A$ greater than **or equal to** the specific value of $\alpha$ (For strong $\alpha$-cut, it is greater than)
    $$
    A_\alpha = \{x\in X | \mu_A(x) \geq \alpha\} \\
    A_{\alpha^+} = \{x\in X | \mu_A(x) > \alpha\} \\
    A_{\alpha=0} = X \\
    A_{\alpha=1} = Core(A) \\
    A_{\alpha^+=0} = Supp(A) \\
    A_{\alpha^+=1} = \empty \\
    $$
    ![1581497511123](CS4486.assets/1581497511123.png)

  * **Level set**: The set of all levels $\alpha \in [0,1]$ that represent distinct $\alpha$-cut of a fuzzy set $A$ is 
    $$
    \Lambda_A=\{\alpha|\exist x\in X\ s.t. \mu_A(x) = \alpha\}
    $$

    * Similar as the concept of **range**

  * **Convex Fuzzy Sets**: For any elements $a,b,c$ in a fuzzy set $A$, the relation $a<b<c$ implies that
    $$
    \mu_A(b) \geq min\{\mu_A(a), \mu_A(c)\}
    $$
    Then $A$ is said to be a convex fuzzy set

    ![1581500149882](CS4486.assets/1581500149882.png) 

    * The following one is convex fuzzy set

      ![1581500170470](CS4486.assets/1581500170470.png)

  * Cardinality of fuzzy set: 

    * Scalar Cardinality
      $$
      SC(A) = |A| = \sum_{x\in X}\mu_A(x) \\
      $$

    * Relative Cardinality
      $$
      RC(A) = {SC(A)\over |Universal\ Set|} = {|A| \over |X|}\\
      $$

      * Only defined for discrete fuzzy set

    * Fuzzy Cardinality
      $$
      FC(A) = \sum_{\alpha \in \Lambda_A} \alpha / |A_{\alpha}|
      $$

  * Example: 

    ![1581499643649](CS4486.assets/1581499643649.png)
    $$
    \Lambda_{adult} = \{0,0.8,1\} \\
    \Lambda_{young} = \{0,0.2,0.5,0.8,1\} \\
    \Lambda_{old} = \{0,0.1,0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8,1\} \\
    SC(old)=|old| = 0+0+0.1+0.2+0.4+0.6+0.8+1+1=4.1 \\
    RC(old) = {4.1 \over 9} = 0.4556 \\
    FC(old) = 0.1/7 + 0.2/6+0.4/5+0.6/4+0.8/3 \\
    $$

* Relationship between Fuzzy Sets and Crisp Sets: Fuzzy sets can be treated as a collection of crisp sets

  ![1581500239325](CS4486.assets/1581500239325.png)

  * Decomposition Theorem: A fuzzy set $A$ can be represented by: 
    $$
    A = \cup_{\alpha \in [0,1]} \alpha . A_{\alpha}
    $$

    * where $\alpha.A_{\alpha}$ denotes the algebraic product of a scalar $\alpha$ with the $\alpha$-cut $A_\alpha$; $\cup$ denotes the union operation
    * This theorem is also applicable to non-convex fuzzy set

* Fuzzy Complement, Union, Intersection

  ![1581501342157](CS4486.assets/1581501342157.png)

  * De Morgan’s laws: 

    * $\overline{A\cap B} = \overline{A}\cup\overline{B}$
    * $\overline{A\cup B} = \overline{A}\cap\overline{B}$

  * Fuzzy **Inclusion and equality**
    $$
    A \subseteq B: if\ \forall x\in X\ \mu_A(x) \leq \mu_B(x) \\
    A \subset B: if\ \forall x\in X \ \mu_A(x) < \mu_B(x) \\
    A = B: if\ \forall x\in X \ \mu_A(x) = \mu_B(x) \\
    A \neq B: if\ \exists x\in X \ \mu_A(x) \neq \mu_B(x) \\
    $$

    * $A\neq B, A\subseteq B$

  * **Fuzzy Complement**: A complement of a fuzzy set $A$ is specified by a function $c:[0,1]\mapsto[0,1]$, which assigns a value $c(\mu_A(x))$ to each membership grade $\mu_A(x)$, satisfy following 4 axioms: 

    * $c(0)=1$ and $c(1)=0$ 

    * For $\mu_A(x)$, $\mu_A(y) \in [0,1]$, if $\mu_A(x) \leq \mu_A(y)$, then $c(\mu_A(x)) \geq c(\mu_A(y))$  

    *  $c$ is a continuous function

    * $c$ is involutive, i.e. $c(c(a))=a$ for all $a \in [0,1]$ 

    * e.g.: 

      * Satisfy first two

      * 

* By default $c(a)=1-a​$ 

* Dual point always equals to the equilibrium but not always 0.5, range?

* Randomness refers to an event that may or may not occur while fuzzyness refers to the boundary of a set that is not precise
