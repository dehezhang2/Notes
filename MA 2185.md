### 1. proposition

* Defination A statement that is either true or false but not both

* 

  * For convenience, use letters (like p, q, e, s) to denote propositions. Then we call these letters as propositional variables
  * The truth value of a proposition P (true if it is true)

* Def: The negation of P is the statement  not P (opposite truth value)

* Def: let p,q two propositions. The conjunction of p,q is P and Q => onlt true and true is true

* Def: let p,q be two propositions THe disjunction of p,q is the proposition P or Q 

* ```
  and : =IF(AND(A2=F1,B2=F1),"T","F")
  or : = IF(OR())
  ```

#### 2. Propositional formula : an expression with finitely many propositional variables and connectives

* output always true => **Tautology**
* output always false => **Contradiction**
* A compound proposition that is neither a tautology nor a contradiction is called a *contingency*
* Let A, B be propositional formulas, we say A, B are $\color {red}{logical\ equivalent}$ if A, B always have the same value.
  * A, B are logical equivalent if A $\iff$ B is a tautology
  * denote as A

#### 3. Predicates and Quantifiers

* P(x) and the truth value depends on x
  * What is the range of x
  * Are we talking about all values of x?
* Def : 
  * predicate is a statement incolcing in a cariable
  * Once are assign values for the variables it become a propostion
* Generally
  * Def: Let P be a predicate with variable x. The universal quantification of P(x) is the proposition P(x) is true for all values of x in the domain
  * read as for all x, P(x)...  or for every x, p(x)...
