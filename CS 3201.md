### 1. Some devices

* Network Interface card : Connects computers to a network using cables. Any device needs a network interface card to connect to the internet
* Network cables : Network cables have connectors on each end that plug into network interface cards
* Cable modern(路由器) : connets your home computer or wireless router to your *Internet Service Provider* (ISP 中国移动) 
* Bluetooth headsets : When Bluetooth is switched on, you device will search for other Bluetooth device to connect to main ebabler if (PAN)
* WIFI router : allow share of internet connection main enabler of (LAN)
* Fare for each device connected to it
  * Hubs : allow devices to connect to each other by plugging network cables into their ports
  * Switch : works similar to hubs, but it can recongonize data (not anyone can access it)
* Router : Allows computers on a LAN to share the same Internet connection
* Bridge: Used to connect multiple LANs together
* Cellular Network Base station: e.g. a 4G station
* A router in the *core network* or wide area network(WAN)

## 1. 1 What is Internet

----------

### 1.1.1 A Nuts-and-Bolts Description

* millions of connected computing devices: *hosts = end systems*
  * running *network apps*
* communication links
  * Fiber, copper, radio, satellite (physical media)
  * transmission **rate** = bandwidth (bits/seconds)
* Packets = header(add by the sender) + segment of file
  * packet switch: receive packets and forward packets toward their ultimate destinations
    * Link-layer switches : used in access networks
    * Routers: forward packets (chunks of data) (packets: divide big file into small units called packets) used in network cores
* Internet: "network of networks"
  * loosely hierarchical (树) => all connected together
  * public Internet versus private intranet
* ISPs : Internet service provider => provide internet-access service to end systems
  - Tier1: national
  - Tier2: regional => connect 1 or more Tier1
  - Tier3: ISPs and local ISPs => closest to end systems
* Protocols controls sending, receiving of msgs
  * e.g. TCP, IP, HTTP, Skype, Ethernet
  * Protocols define **format, order** of msgs sent and received among network entities, and **actions ** taken on msg transmission and receiption  
  * Internet standards
    * RFC: Request for comments
    * IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force

### 1.1.2 A Services Description

* Distributed applications: Applications involve multiple end systems that exchange data with each other, and run a the end systems.

* Service

  * communication *infrastructure* (and delivery system i.e. protocols) enables distributed applications
    * Web, VoIP, email, games, e-commerce, file sharing
  * communication services provided to apps:
    * Reliable data delivery from source to destination
    * "Best effort" (unreliable) data delivery => some times we prefer loss of bits than speed of transformation(online game/movie)

## 1.2 The network edge

-------------

### 1.2.1 Access Networks

* network edge: applications and hosts 
* Hosts / end systems
  * client
  * server
* access networks(edge router): the network that physically connects an end system to the **first** router 
  * e.g.
    * DSL (digital subscriber line) : A residence typically obtains DSL Internet access from the same local telephone company (telco) that provides its wired local phone access.  
    * Cable, FTTH, Dial-Up and Satellite
  * Properties
    * slower than core
    * dedicated(私有)

----------

### 1.3 The Network Core

#### 1.3.1 Packet switching

* Store-and-Forward Transmission :packet switch must receive the entire packet before it can begin to transmit the first bit of the packet onto the outbound link 
  * Consider : source has three packets, each consist of L bits
  * First buffer the packet's bits : size of packets is L, rate is R
  * transmission(for one packet) delay = (L/R)*number of links
* Queuing Delays and Packet Loss
  * For each link linked to the **output buffer**(output queue)
  * Store the packets to the queue when the output link is busy
  * The queue has finity capacity
  * packet arriving to full queue dropped (aka lost)
  * lost packet may be retransmitted by previous node, by source end system, or not at all
* Forwarding Tables and Routing Protocols
  * IP address of target host is writen in the header of packets by the sender host
  * Forwarding table: Each router has an forward table that maps destination addresses
  * Packets' IP is read by the table to find appropriate outbound link

#### 1.3.2 Circuit Switching

* circuit-switched network : set up a new path between sourse and target

  - dedicated resources: no sharing

  -  circuit-like (guaranteed) performance

  - call setup required

  - dividing link bandwidth into “pieces”

    - frequency-division multiplexing : share channel

      - FM radio stations also use FDM to share the frequency spectrum between 88 MHz and 108 MHz, with each station being allocated a specific frequency band. 

    - Time-division multiplexing(TDM): use whole channel but share on time

      - Frame: time is divided into frames of fixed duration 
      - Slots: each frame is divided into a fixed number of time slots
      - When the network establishes a connection across a link, the network dedicates one time slot in every frame to this connection 
      - transmission rate of a circuit is equal to the frame rate multiplied by the number of bits in a slot (frame per second*number of bits in a slot = slot per second/slot per frame * number of bits)
      - Bit rate: total bits per second
      - transmission rate: for one slot (bit rate/slots per sec)

      $$
      dely\ time=time\ to\ set\ up+{packet\ size\over( {bit\ rate\over slots\ per\ sec})}(total\ slots)
      $$

* Packet Switching Versus Circuit Switching

  * packet-switching: data sent thru net in discrete “chunks” （router决定下一个方向， if busy store into buffer）
    * A, B packets share $\color{red}{network}$ resources
    * each packet uses full link bandwidth
    * resource contention
      * aggregate resource demand can exceed amount available
      * congestion: packets queue, wait for link use
      * store and forward: packets move one hop at a time
      * Node receives complete packet before forwarding
  * Statistical multiplexing
    - Sequence of A & B packets does not have fixed pattern, bandwidth shared on demand => statistical multiplexing
    - each host gets same slot in revolving TDM frame
  * transmit delay : (num of edges*size of file)/deliver rate
  * packet switching > circuit switching
    - Great for bursty(Discrete) data
      - resource sharing
      - Simpler, no call setup
    - excessive congestion: packet delay and loss
      - protocols needed for reliable data transfer, congestion control
    - How to provide circuit-like behaviour
      - bandwidth guarantees needed for audio/video apps (pay for the service)

* network core: 
  * interconnected **routers**
  * network of networks

### 1.4 Delay, Loss, and Throughput in Packet-Switched Networks

* Four sources of delay

  - Nodal processing : check bit errors and determine output link （negligible 可忽略）

  - Queueing : time waiting at output for transmission and depends on congestion level of router  (not negligible)

  - Transmission delay : L(file size)/R(rate) (negligible)

  - Propagation delay : down voteaccepted (negligible)

    Propagation delay is how long it takes *one* bit to *travel* from one end of the "wire" to the other (it's proportional to the length of the wire, crudely).

    Transmission delay is how long it takes to get *all* the bits *into* the wire in the first place (it's packet_length/data_rate).
    $$
    d_{nodal}=d_{proc}+d_{queue}+d_{trans}+d_{pop} 
    $$

  - Throughput

    - Throughput: rate(bits/time unit) at which bits transfeered between sender/receiver (observe from receiver side)
      - Instantaneous : At any instant of time is the rate(bits/sec) at which Host B is receiving the file
      - Average : 平均速度 F(whole bits)/T(whole time)
      - Consider $R_S$ is the rate of link between server and router $R_c$ denote the rate of the link between client and router, then the transmission rate is min($R_S$,$R_c$)
      - Per-connection end-end throughput: min($R_S$,$,R_c$, R/10)
      - in practice: $R_S$ and $R_c$ is oftehn bottleneck
