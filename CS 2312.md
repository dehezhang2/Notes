### 1. Explanation of the Program

* Class name start with Uppercase, same as the file name
* static means we don't need to initialize object to run the main function
* ```args[]``` is an array of String (Strings after the command line run the java code)

### 2. Packages

* Groups of classes ```java.util.*``` where * represent all the class under the folder
* ```import static java.lang.math``` where static means if we use static methods in the imported class
* A class not grouped into package folder and has the packet statement
* Comment : /** */ for automatic documentation

### 3. Data types

* Division
  * 8 primitive types : boolean, byte, short, int, long, float, double, char
  * Reference type : 
    * Built-in Java classes : String, Math, Scanner
    * User-defined classes 
    * Ab array is also a object

* Integer types

  * java has no unsigned types (memory is not so precious now)
  * Long integer numbers have a suffix L (add L at the end of the number)
  * Similarly, provide in Binary add prefix '0b', provide in Hexadecimal, add prefix '0x'
  * Float suffix 'F' double no suffix or add 'D' 
  * E+18 represent $*10^{18}$ 

* boolean type : cannot converted from integer

* Constants

  * Java keyword is ```final``` , means the value cannot be changed any more

    ```java
    final double MAX;
    //in class
    public static final int MAX;
    ```
