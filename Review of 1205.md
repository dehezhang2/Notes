## suply and demand

### Economcs modeling 

> assumption -> logical deduction -> Deriving implication -> Hypothesis testing

### Assumption

**People are rational**

* An individual will take an action iff MB > Mc

* *Cost-Benefit principle*

* Marginal benefit: *extra* benefit that the individual gains when taking the action

* Marginal cost: -- cost ---------------

### Opportunity Cost

> Value of waht must be forgone or drop in order to undertake the activity

### Incentive Principle

* A person is more likely to take an action if its benefit rises

* use relevant costs and benefits to predict behavior

### Demand & Supply

*How market allocate resources?*

* Market:
	> Visible

	> Invisible 

* Parties:

	1.Consumer(Demand)

	* What consumers are *willing* and *able* to buy at various prices 
	
	* Marginal benefit (MB): Satisfaction or utility from consuming the **last** unit of the good consumed
	
	* Market demand = Sum of (all consumers' demand)

	* Function: Qdx(Quantity Demanded) = f(Px,Py,I,Pe)
	  
	* Px(own price), Py(relative price)
	I(income of consumer),Pe(Expectation of future price)

	* Assumption: Ceteris Paribus: holding other factors constant (Qdx=-10Px+6Py+12I) 

	* Conclusion: 
	 
	> Price and Qd are negatively related
 
	> Law of Demand: Lower price -> larger demanded

	* Change in demand
	 
	> Change in Px -> move along the curve
	
	> Change in income(Py) -> shifting of the curve  
	 
	> price of related goods
	>
	> > substitutes (replace)
	> >
	> > Complements (hubu)
	>
	> Consumer's income
	>
	> > Noirmal(superior) goods (Buy more with high income)
	>
	> > Inferior (Buy more with less income) goods

	> Market Demand
 
	> > Horizontal summation
 
	> > add quatities at the same level of price
 
	
	2.Producer(Supply) 

	* A producer wants and able to sell something
	
	* Function: Qsx = f(Px,Py,C,Pe) (C= cost of production)
	
	* Similar to the demand curve
	 
	* Conculsion:
	
	 > Positive related
	 > 
	 > **Law of Supply** : the lower the price of a good, the smaller the quantity supplied


	* Change in Qs:
	
	> Change in price -> move along the curve  
	> 
	> Cost of product down -> shift of the curve 
	
	* Horizontal summation
	
### Equilibrium

	* Equilibrium is a situation that both price and quantity have no tendency to change.  
	
	* The interaction of the demand and supply gives the equilibrium price and quantity.
	
	* The equilibrium tells the producers how many they can sell.
	
	* The equilibrium tells the consumers how many they can buy.
	
### Equilibrium Analysis

* Decide whether the event shifts the supply or demand curve (or both)
	
* Decide whether the curve(s) shift(s) to the left or to the right
	
* upply-and-demand diagram to see how the shift affects (Qx & Quatity)
	
### Market Equilibrium

> Efficient: MB = MC
> Underproduction: MB > MC
> Overproduction: MB < MC
	
### Profit Maximization

	Profit(PI the area) = Total revenue + Total Cost

> a company will produce as long as MC < Price of the product
	
### Technical efficiency

> production decisions that generate **maximum output** given some stock of resources



### Evaluating the Market Equilibrium 

1. Competitive markets allocate the supply to buyers pay highly
2. Competitive markets allocate the demand to sellers who produce at least cost
3. Competitive markets produce allocatively efficient quantity of goods
4. Maximize **social welfare**

### Is First-Come-First-Served-Efficient?

* No, it's not
* But, fair
