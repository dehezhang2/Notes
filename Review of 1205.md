## suply and demand

### Economcs modeling 

> assumption -> logical deduction -> Deriving implication -> Hypothesis testing

------------------------------
### Assumption

**People are rational**

* An individual will take an action iff MB > Mc

* *Cost-Benefit principle*

* Marginal benefit: *extra* benefit that the individual gains when taking the action

* Marginal cost: -- cost ---------------

----------------------------
### Opportunity Cost

> Value of waht must be forgone or drop in order to undertake the activity

--------------------------------
### Incentive Principle

* A person is more likely to take an action if its benefit rises

* use relevant costs and benefits to predict behavior

-----------------------------
### Demand & Supply

*How market allocate resources?*

* Market:
	> Visible

	> Invisible 

* Parties:

	1.Consumer(Demand)

	* What consumers are *willing* and *able* to buy at various prices 
	
	* Marginal benefit (MB): Satisfaction or utility from consuming the **last** unit of the good consumed
	
	* Market demand = Sum of (all consumers' demand)

	* Function: Qdx(Quantity Demanded) = f(Px,Py,I,Pe)
	  
	* Px(own price), Py(relative price)
	I(income of consumer),Pe(Expectation of future price)

	* Assumption: Ceteris Paribus: holding other factors constant (Qdx=-10Px+6Py+12I) 

	* Conclusion: 
	 
	> Price and Qd are negatively related
 
	> Law of Demand: Lower price -> larger demanded

	* Change in demand
	 
	> Change in Px -> move along the curve
	
	> Change in income(Py) -> shifting of the curve  
	 
	> price of related goods
	>
	> > substitutes (replace)
	> >
	> > Complements (hubu)
	>
	> Consumer's income
	>
	> > Noirmal(superior) goods (Buy more with high income)
	>
	> > Inferior (Buy more with less income) goods

	> Market Demand
 
	> > Horizontal summation
 
	> > add quatities at the same level of price
 
	
	2.Producer(Supply) 

	* A producer wants and able to sell something
	
	* Function: Qsx = f(Px,Py,C,Pe) (C= cost of production)
	
	* Similar to the demand curve
	 
	* Conculsion:
	
	 > Positive related
	 > 
	 > **Law of Supply** : the lower the price of a good, the smaller the quantity supplied


	* Change in Qs:
	
	> Change in price -> move along the curve  
	> 
	> Cost of product down -> shift of the curve 
	
	* Horizontal summation
	
-----------------------------
	
### Equilibrium

	* Equilibrium is a situation that both price and quantity have no tendency to change.  
	
	* The interaction of the demand and supply gives the equilibrium price and quantity.
	
	* The equilibrium tells the producers how many they can sell.
	
	* The equilibrium tells the consumers how many they can buy.

-------------------------------
### Equilibrium Analysis

* Decide whether the event shifts the supply or demand curve (or both)
	
* Decide whether the curve(s) shift(s) to the left or to the right
	
* upply-and-demand diagram to see how the shift affects (Qx & Quatity)

----------------------------------	
### Market Equilibrium

> Efficient: MB = MC
> Underproduction: MB > MC
> Overproduction: MB < MC
	
-------------------------------------
### Profit Maximization

	Profit(PI the area) = Total revenue + Total Cost

> a company will produce as long as MC < Price of the product
	
------------------------------------
### Technical efficiency

> production decisions that generate **maximum output** given some stock of resources


-----------------------------------------
### Evaluating the Market Equilibrium 

1. Competitive markets allocate the supply to buyers pay highly
2. Competitive markets allocate the demand to sellers who produce at least cost
3. Competitive markets produce allocatively efficient quantity of goods
4. Maximize **social welfare**

-------------------------------------------
### Is First-Come-First-Served-Efficient?

* No, it's not
* But, fair

------------------------------
# Lecture 03

## Social Welfare and Market Failiure

### Social Welfare

A market is efficient if the total economic welfare of all participants is maximized.

Social welfare= Consumer's surplus + producer's surplus
> Consumer's gain: Consumer Surplus
> 
> Producer's gain: Producer Surplus

-------------------
### Consumer Surplus

* Difference between the consumer's willingness to pay(demand price) and need to pay(actual price) for *an amount of products*(The area)
 
* Total consumer surplus= sum(consumer surplus from each unit) 

------------------
### Producer Surplus

* Difference between the money received by the produver and the cost of production (MC) and price of product (The area)

* Total producer surplus= Sum(producter surplus from each unit)

-----------------
### How a Tax Affects the Market

* A tax places a tax wedge between the price buyers pay and the price sellers receive
> Buyer pay more
> 
> Seller receive less

* Tax wage -> quatity falls
* Goverment's tax revenue= T(tax)*Q(quantity sold)
* [picture](https://canvas.cityu.edu.hk/courses/23036/files?preview=3297687)
* Step to find the shifted curve
	1. down-shift the demand curve  or up-shift the supply curve
	2. Find the new quantity and draw a line down to the q-axis
	3. Find the two intersection of the line and the two curves 
	4. Find tax revenue CS PS and DDL

-------------------
### Market Failure

* When markets are inefficient, there are
missed opportunities.

* Reasons for market failure
	> Imperfect information (Asymmetric information)
	> Icomplete property rights(Common property)
	> Market Power (Monopoly)(long duan)
	
---------------
### Economic of Pollution

* Modeled as public goods or externalities

> public goods: Market(Good for sell) defined as *environmental quality* , then source of market failure is a public good

> externality: Market defined as *good generates environmental damage*, then the market failure is due to  a negative externality

------------------------
### Important Characteristic of Goods

* excludable: if person can be prevented from using it(subjective)

> Excludable: food, movies, Internet access
> 
> Not excludable: TV and radio broadcast, national defense, good weather

* rival: A good is rival in consumption if one person’s
use of it diminishes others’ use.

> Rival: fish, drinking water, ice-cream
> 
> Not rival: Music MP3 file, fresh air, outdoor concert

<tr><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr>

</table>
	
----------------------------------
### Market analysis for public good
> Supply: MC
> 
> Demand: **Vertical summation**(at the same level of quantity add the price)

-----------
### Market Failure: Public goods

* No one want to pay for the public goods(due to nonexcludability characteristics)

* Result is that market demand is  	undefined(property)

* nonrevelation of preferences arises due to free-ridership 

----------------------
### Externalities

* Def: effect associated
with production or consumption that extends
to a third party outside the market

> Negative externalities: generate cost to third party
> 
> Positive externalities: generate benefits to a third party
>
> MPC: cost for producer
>
> MPB: benefit for consumers
> 
> MSC: MPC + MEC(negative externalities)
> 
> MSB: MPB + MEB(positive externalities)
> 
> [picture](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FtLAJACwXcf1uNRVGpRFNl23pEHPDvnC)
>
> MEC -> turn of the curve -> DDL + EC(external cost)
>
> If Q reduced to the efficient quantity -> Society gain = DDL in the prevent case
> 
> public good: for large scope<br/>Externality: for small scope 

------------------------
### Property rights

* Underlying source of failure is absence of
property rights.

* Property Rights: Valid claims to a good or
resource that permits sale and use

* If property right exist in some form but are ill
defined, the outcome will also be an inefficient
one.

--------------------
### Market failure: common resources

* Each person’s use reduces

others’ ability to use

* Role for government to ensure

that they are not overused

* Tragedy : The private incentives (using the land for free)
outweigh the social incentives (using it carefully).

-----------------------------
### Coase Theorem(bargin)

* Assume: 

> Costless transactions

> Costless coordination and organization of groups

> Damages are observable and measurable

* Three cases
> Case 1: benefit for polluter to pollute < damage to third party -> third party pay polluter for not polluting
> 
> Case 2: benefit for polluter to pollute > damage to third party && no monitor -> no one pay, pollute stays
> 
> Case 3: benefit for polluter to pollute > damage to third party && monitor exist -> polluter pay for pollute
>

* Analysis

> In the graph: MEC = MSC -MPC >= third party willing to pay
> 
> MPI = MPB - MPC when MEC > MPT i.e. MSC > MPB bargin exist
> 
> Limitation: 

	1. assumption is hard to achieve(transacation cost & coordination cost & hard to measure)

	2. Fails when there are more than a few individuals are involved on each side of the market
	
	3. Irrational antagonism and stubbornness
