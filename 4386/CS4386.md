### History of AI and Games

* Alan Turing’s Chess Program:
  * (re)invented Minimax algorithm and use it to play chess in 1950
* Tic-Tac-Toe game by A.S. Douglas:
  * The first software to master a game is a digital version of the Tic-Tc-Toe game, also known as Noughts and Crosses (or OXO) in 1952
* Arthur Samuel’s Checker Program
  * Arthur Samuel invented the form of machine learning that is now called reinforcement learning using a program that learned to play Checkers by playing against itself in 1956
* Early Research on Game-Playing AI
  * Classic board games such as Checkers and Chess are the focus
  * These game have complexity arising from simple rules
* Checkers: 
  * 3 decades of research on tree search
  * Chinook Checkers player managed to beat the World Checkers Champion in 1994
  * Checkers game was solved in 2007
