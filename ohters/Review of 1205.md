## suply and demand

### Economcs modeling 

> assumption -> logical deduction -> Deriving implication -> Hypothesis testing

------------------------------
### Assumption

**People are rational**

* An individual will take an action iff MB > Mc

* *Cost-Benefit principle*

* Marginal benefit: *extra* benefit that the individual gains when taking the action

* Marginal cost: -- cost ---------------

----------------------------
### Opportunity Cost

> Value of waht must be forgone or drop in order to undertake the activity

--------------------------------
### Incentive Principle

* A person is more likely to take an action if its benefit rises

* use relevant costs and benefits to predict behavior

-----------------------------
### Demand & Supply

*How market allocate resources?*

* Market:
	> Visible

	> Invisible 

* Parties:

	1.Consumer(Demand)

	* What consumers are *willing* and *able* to buy at various prices 
	
	* Marginal benefit (MB): Satisfaction or utility from consuming the **last** unit of the good consumed
	
	* Market demand = Sum of (all consumers' demand)

	* Function: Qdx(Quantity Demanded) = f(Px,Py,I,Pe)
	  
	* Px(own price), Py(relative price)
	I(income of consumer),Pe(Expectation of future price)

	* Assumption: Ceteris Paribus: holding other factors constant (Qdx=-10Px+6Py+12I) 

	* Conclusion: 
	
	> Price and Qd are negatively related

	> Law of Demand: Lower price -> larger demanded

	* Change in demand
	
	> Change in Px -> move along the curve
	
	> Change in income(Py) -> shifting of the curve  
	
	> price of related goods
	>
	> > substitutes (replace)
	> >
	> > Complements (hubu)
	>
	> Consumer's income
	>
	> > Noirmal(superior) goods (Buy more with high income)
	>
	> > Inferior (Buy more with less income) goods

	> Market Demand

	> > Horizontal summation

	> > add quatities at the same level of price

	
	2.Producer(Supply) 

	* A producer wants and able to sell something
	
	* Function: Qsx = f(Px,Py,C,Pe) (C= cost of production)
	
	* Similar to the demand curve
	
	* Conculsion:
	
	 > Positive related
	 > 
	 > **Law of Supply** : the lower the price of a good, the smaller the quantity supplied


	* Change in Qs:
	
	> Change in price -> move along the curve  
	> 
	> Cost of product down -> shift of the curve 
	
	* Horizontal summation

-----------------------------

### Equilibrium

	* Equilibrium is a situation that both price and quantity have no tendency to change.  
	
	* The interaction of the demand and supply gives the equilibrium price and quantity.
	
	* The equilibrium tells the producers how many they can sell.
	
	* The equilibrium tells the consumers how many they can buy.

-------------------------------
### Equilibrium Analysis

* Decide whether the event shifts the supply or demand curve (or both)
	
* Decide whether the curve(s) shift(s) to the left or to the right
	
* upply-and-demand diagram to see how the shift affects (Qx & Quatity)

	---------------------------------
### Market Equilibrium

> Efficient: MB = MC
> Underproduction: MB > MC
> Overproduction: MB < MC

-------------------------------------
### Profit Maximization

	Profit(PI the area) = Total revenue + Total Cost

> a company will produce as long as MC < Price of the product

------------------------------------
### Technical efficiency

> production decisions that generate **maximum output** given some stock of resources

-----------------------------------------
### Evaluating the Market Equilibrium 

1. Competitive markets allocate the supply to buyers pay highly
2. Competitive markets allocate the demand to sellers who produce at least cost
3. Competitive markets produce allocatively efficient quantity of goods
4. Maximize **social welfare**

-------------------------------------------
### Is First-Come-First-Served-Efficient?

* No, it's not
* But, fair

------------------------------
<h1 id="3">Lecture 03</h1>

## Social Welfare and Market Failiure

### Social Welfare

A market is efficient if the total economic welfare of all participants is maximized.

Social welfare= Consumer's surplus + producer's surplus
> Consumer's gain: Consumer Surplus
> 
> Producer's gain: Producer Surplus

-------------------
### Consumer Surplus

* Difference between the consumer's willingness to pay(demand price) and need to pay(actual price) for *an amount of products*(The area)

* Total consumer surplus= sum(consumer surplus from each unit) 

------------------
### Producer Surplus

* Difference between the money received by the produver and the cost of production (MC) and price of product (The area)

* Total producer surplus= Sum(producter surplus from each unit)

-----------------
### How a Tax Affects the Market

* A tax places a tax wedge between the price buyers pay and the price sellers receive
> Buyer pay more
> 
> Seller receive less

* Tax wage -> quatity falls
* Goverment's tax revenue= T(tax)*Q(quantity sold)
* [picture](https://canvas.cityu.edu.hk/courses/23036/files?preview=3297687)
* Step to find the shifted curve
	1. down-shift the demand curve  or up-shift the supply curve
	2. Find the new quantity and draw a line down to the q-axis
	3. Find the two intersection of the line and the two curves 
	4. Find tax revenue CS PS and DDL

-------------------
### Market Failure

* When markets are inefficient, there are
missed opportunities.

* Reasons for market failure
	> Imperfect information (Asymmetric information)
	> Icomplete property rights(Common property)
	> Market Power (Monopoly)(long duan)
	
---------------
### Economic of Pollution

* Modeled as public goods or externalities

> public goods: Market(Good for sell) defined as *environmental quality* , then source of market failure is a public good

> externality: Market defined as *good generates environmental damage*, then the market failure is due to  a negative externality

------------------------
### Important Characteristic of Goods

* excludable: if person can be prevented from using it(subjective)

> Excludable: food, movies, Internet access
> 
> Not excludable: TV and radio broadcast, national defense, good weather

* rival: A good is rival in consumption if one person’s
use of it diminishes others’ use.

> Rival: fish, drinking water, ice-cream
> 
> Not rival: Music MP3 file, fresh air, outdoor concert

<table>
<tr><th colspan="2" rowspan="2"></th><th colspan="2">Rival?</th></tr>
<tr><td>Yes</td><td>No</td></tr>

</table>
	
----------------------------------
### Market analysis for public good
> Supply: MC
> 
> Demand: **Vertical summation**(at the same level of quantity add the price)

-----------
### Market Failure: Public goods

* No one want to pay for the public goods(due to nonexcludability characteristics)

	 Result is that market demand is  	undefined(property)

* nonrevelation of preferences arises due to free-ridership 

----------------------
### Externalities

* Def: effect associated
with production or consumption that extends
to a third party outside the market

> Negative externalities: generate cost to third party
> 
> Positive externalities: generate benefits to a third party
>
> MPC: cost for producer
>
> MPB: benefit for consumers
> 
> MSC: MPC + MEC(negative externalities)
> 
> MSB: MPB + MEB(positive externalities)
> 
> [picture](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FtLAJACwXcf1uNRVGpRFNl23pEHPDvnC)
>
> MEC -> turn of the curve -> DDL + EC(external cost)
>
> If Q reduced to the efficient quantity -> Society gain = DDL in the prevent case
> 
> public good: for large scope<br/>Externality: for small scope 

------------------------
### Property rights

* Underlying source of failure is absence of
property rights.

* Property Rights: Valid claims to a good or
resource that permits sale and use

* If property right exist in some form but are ill
defined, the outcome will also be an inefficient
one.

--------------------
### Market failure: common resources

* Each person’s use reduces
  others’ ability to use

* Role for government to ensure
  that they are not overused

* Tragedy : The private incentives (using the land for free) outweigh the social incentives (using it carefully).

-----------------------------
### Coase Theorem(bargin)

* Assume: 

> Costless transactions

> Costless coordination and organization of groups

> Damages are observable and measurable

* Three cases
> Case 1: benefit for polluter to pollute < damage to third party -> third party pay polluter for not polluting
> 
> Case 2: benefit for polluter to pollute > damage to third party && no monitor -> no one pay, pollute stays
> 
> Case 3: benefit for polluter to pollute > damage to third party && monitor exist -> polluter pay for pollute
> 
> [picture](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FtLAJACwXcf1uNRVGpRFNl23pEHPDvnC)

* Analysis

> In the graph: MEC = MSC -MPC >= third party willing to pay
> 
> MPI = MPB - MPC when MEC > MPT i.e. MSC > MPB bargin exist
> 
> Limitation: 

	1. assumption is hard to achieve(transacation cost & coordination cost & hard to measure)
	
	2. Fails when there are more than a few individuals are involved on each side of the market
	
	3. Irrational antagonism and stubbornness

## Conventional Solutions to Environmental Problems: The Command-and-Control Approach

### Policy solutions

Two broad defined approaches:

* The command and control approach (using **standards and rules** to control pollution)

* The market approach (using incentive and market force to motivate or encourage abatement and conservaton 

--------------------------
### Standards

> **Ambient(general) standards**: designates
the quality of the environment to be achieved.
>
> **Technology-based standard**: a standard that
designates the equipment or method to be
used to achieve some abatement level (method define)
>
> **Performance-based standard**: a standard that
specifies a pollution limit for residuals from a
plant(focus on output) 

----------------------------
### Economic Implication of Standards

Two key questions: <br/>
1. Are standards set to achieve *allocatively efficiency*(i.e. MC = MB)?
	. Given some environmental objective, is that objective being achieved in a manner that is *technically efficient*(cost effective lower the cost by using another strategy)	

-------------------------------
### Abatement

* MSB for abatement: additional social gain as pollution abatement increase. MSB = sum(all the reductions in MEC across markets where pollution is reduced)

> negative sloped: MSB is reduction of MEC, as MEC is increasing as Q increase. For start point reduce a unit of product reduce more MEC

* MSC for abatement: increase with Abatement (A), hard to enforce

* MAC= polluters' abatement cost (Equals forgone Mπ if the **least-cost** abatement method is to reduce output) (Not the area)
* MCE= Goverment's cost of enforcement

	MSC = MSC + MCE

* allocatively efficient level of abatement: Ae occurs when MSB = MSC

------------------------
### Why Standards May Not Be Efficient

* Political Constraints
	* standards may be benefit based(benefit society consider the MCE)
	* Regulator may captured by the industry
	
* Regional difference: Ae good for national level, but not for regional level
	* (MSBx < MSB <MSBy) -> Aex< Ae <Aey 
	
* Imperfect information
	* Inability to identify MSB or MSC

	* MSB − Consumers’ problem of non-revelation of
      preferences

	* MSC − Difficulty in identifying each firm’s MAC,
	  including non-monetary costs
* Non-uniformity of pollutants

----------------------------
### Cost Effectiveness

If allocatively efficient standards are unlikely, we use cost-effectiveness to evaluate how standards are
implemented

* identify the cheapest method(But **command-and-control decisions may violate this criterion**)

* **Performance standard > Technology standard**(select the most cost efficient way)

* Uniform performance-based standards are
inefficient if abatement costs differ among
polluting sources **(low-abatement-cost can do more)**

> for n polluter uniform performance = Ast/n
> 
> But it may not equal to all polluters MAC
> 
> [picture](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FtLAJACwXcf1uNRVGpRFNl23pEHPDvnC)
> 
> geverment don't know MAC of each polluter
> 
> Efficient result is possible using market-based approach

## Economic Solutions to Environment Problems: The Market Approach

### Examples: 

1. pollution charge
2. subsides
3. Deposit/refund systems
4. Pollution permit trading systems

---------------------
### pollution charge

* product charge & User charge
	* **Pigouvian tax** is when tax equals the marginal external cost (MEC) at the efficient quantity, QE (in order to shift the quantity from Qc to Qe)
	* Pros: can achieve an efficient outcome
	* Cons:<br/> 1. in practice it is difficult to identify<br/>
			2.  can only achieve abatement but cannot achieve better abatement technology
	
* Emission charge
	* imposed directly on the discharge of pollution
	* implemented through a tax.
	* producer faced the choice
	
		1. case of a single polluter
			Marginal tax (MT) = t
			Total Tax Revenue = t*(Ast-A0)(A0 is actual pollute beyond Ast) when (A = A0) -> MAC = MT
			[picture](https://canvas.cityu.edu.hk/courses/23036/files?preview=3297688)

		2. case of multiple polluter
			Achieve low-abatement-cost do more because of the tax (choose pay tax or abate)
	
		3. **Notice**: 
			* Ast depends on the MSC and MSB curve of externality. MT is depends on MAC and Ast to achieve when MT = MAC, A0 = Ast
			* tax for emission charge is also a pigovian tax ((MSC-MPC=MEC)=(MPB-MPC=MAC)=MT)
	
	*  pros: (2 static 1 dynamic)
		*  Abatement standard is met at a least-cost method.
		* Generates $40 in tax revenues from high-cost abater and $10 from low-cost abater
		* Encourage firms to advance its abatement technology.
		
	* cons: 
		* Environmental authority will not know what level of tax will achieve abatement goals
		* Monitoring costs are potentially higher
		* Firms might evade tax by illegally disposing pollutants
		* Distributional implications(tax affect different firm differently)
* Administrative charge

------------------------
### Abatement Subsidies

* Abatement equipment Subsidies
	* * **Pigouvian subsidy** is when subsidy equals the marginal external benefit (MEB) at the efficient quantity, QE (in order to shift the quantity from Qc to Qe)
	* cons: <br/>
		* Difficult to measure the MEB
		* May bias polluters’ decisions about how best to abate
		* Income distribution effect(tax provide money of subsidy)
	
* Per-unit subsidy on pollution reduction
	s*(Zst-Z0)(Z is level of pollution)

--------------------------
### Refundable User Charge

A deposit/refund system is a market-based instrument to reduce waste

* Target: *potential* vs. actual polluter

* the deposit is intended to capture the MEC of 
**improper waste disposal (IW)** in advance

* Preventive scheme

* graph--similar to tax but the money will be back if you abatement

* pros: 
	* Promotes responsible behavior
	* Requires minimal supervision by government
	* Can help slow the use of virgin raw materials by improving availability of recycled materials
	
-----------------------------------------
### Pollution Permit Trading Systems

Establishes a **market for rights to pollute** by issuing **tradable** pollution credits(uniformed Ast/n but tradable) or allowances

* two components
  * fixed number of permits
  * tradable

* **Bargaining** gives rise to a market for pollution rights

* How it works?(remind the question MACx<MACy)

  > Higher polluter buy permits from lower
  > when MAcx = MACy stop
  > the MAC at the end point is the trade price

* Pollution permits vs Pigovian tax
  * Pogovian set the price of pollution 
  * Permit set the quantity of pollution
  * Assessing Pollution Permits: Trading establishes the price of a right to pollute **without government having to “search” for a price**
  * Trading system is flexible (goverment simply change the standard)
  * No tax revenues are generated
