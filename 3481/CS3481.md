* Applications
  * Business
  * Science & Engineering
  * Medicine
* Data Mining: A fundamental approach in data science which allows **automatic discovery** of **useful** information in **large** data repositories. (Looking up individual records using a database management system or finding particular Web pages via a query to an Internet search engine are not data mining.)
* Process of Knowledge Discovery in Database (KDD)
  * Data cleaning: A process that **removes noise** and inconsistent data
  * Data integration: The stage where **multiple** data sources are **combined**
  * Data selection: The stage where data **relevant** to the analysis task are **retrieved** from the database.
  * Data transformation: The stage where data are **transformed** **into** forms **suitable** for mining.
  * Data mining: An important process where intelligent and efficient **methods** are **applied** to **extract patterns**.
  * Pattern evaluation: A process that identifies the truly **interesting** patterns representing knowledge **based on interestingness measures**.
  * Knowledge presentation: The stage where **visualization** and knowledge **representation** techniques are used to **present** the mined knowledge to the user.

* Challenges
  * Scalability: Algorithms scalable to handle massive data sets, which may require
    * Employing special search strategies 
    * Implementing novel data structures
    * Using sampling
    * Developing parallel & distributed algorithms
  * High dimensionality: Encounter large number of features
  * Heterogeneous and complex data: Deal with data sets containing attributes of the different types
* Areas related
  * Statistics: Sampling, estimation, hypothesis testing
  * AI & pattern recognition & ML: Search Algorithms, Modeling techniques, learning theories
  * Database systems
  * High performance computation techniques
  * Distributed techniques

### Tasks

![1578475368569](CS3481.assets/1578475368569.png)

* Predictive Modeling
  * Predict value of a particular attribute (target/dependent variable) based on the values of others (explanatory or independent variables)
  * Types
    * Classification: Discrete target variables (Predicting kind of flowers or web robot detection)
    * Regression: Continuous target variables
  * Goal: minimize the error between predicted and true values of the target variable
* Association Analysis
  * Discover patterns that describe strongly associated items in the data
  * Patterns represented in implications rules or item subsets
* Cluster Analysis: Seeks to find groups of closely related observations

## Lecture 02: Data

### Basic Concepts 

* Data set: Collection of data objects
* Data object: record, point, vector, pattern, event, case, sample, observation or entity.
