* Linked list

  * Insert

    * consider special case of empty list
    * Case1: add in front of the list : 

    ```
    newnode->next = first;
    first = newnode
    ```

    * Case2: Insert in the middle

    ```
    newnode->next = p->next;
    p->next = newnode;
    ```

    * Case3: Insert at the end

    ```
    // same as the case 3 => reuse the code
    ```

  * Remove

    * Search by value remove by reference
    * Cases : beginning/not beginning
      * Case1 : Remove at the beginning of the list
        * Current status : the node pointed by "first" is unwanted ```first=first->next``` 
        * ```q=first;first=q->next;delete q;```
      * Case 2 : Remove a node not at the beginning of the list
        * ```p->next = q->next; delete q;```

* Dummy Header Node

  * In order to remove the empty case

* Double-linked list

  * add a Link to the pre node for every node

* Disadvantage : random access time *O(n)*
