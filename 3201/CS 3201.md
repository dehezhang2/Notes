### 1. Some devices

* Network Interface card : Connects computers to a network using cables. Any device needs a network interface card to connect to the internet
* Network cables : Network cables have connectors on each end that plug into network interface cards
* Cable modern(路由器) : connets your home computer or wireless router to your *Internet Service Provider* (ISP 中国移动) 
* Bluetooth headsets : When Bluetooth is switched on, you device will search for other Bluetooth device to connect to main ebabler if (PAN)
* WIFI router : allow share of internet connection main enabler of (LAN)
* Fare for each device connected to it
  * Hubs : allow devices to connect to each other by plugging network cables into their ports
  * Switch : works similar to hubs, but it can recongonize data (not anyone can access it)
* Router : Allows computers on a LAN to share the same Internet connection
* Bridge: Used to connect multiple LANs together
* Cellular Network Base station: e.g. a 4G station
* A router in the *core network* or wide area network(WAN)

## 1. 1 What is Internet

----------

### 1.1.1 A Nuts-and-Bolts Description

* millions of connected computing devices: *hosts = end systems*
  * running *network apps*
* communication links
  * Fiber, copper, radio, satellite (physical media)
  * transmission **rate** = bandwidth (bits/seconds)
* Packets = header(add by the sender) + segment of file
  * packet switch: receive packets and forward packets toward their ultimate destinations
    * Link-layer switches : used in access networks
    * Routers: forward packets (chunks of data) (packets: divide big file into small units called packets) used in network cores
* Internet: "network of networks"
  * loosely hierarchical (树) => all connected together
  * public Internet versus private intranet
* ISPs : Internet service provider => provide internet-access service to end systems
  - Tier1: national
  - Tier2: regional => connect 1 or more Tier1
  - Tier3: ISPs and local ISPs => closest to end systems
* Protocols controls sending, receiving of msgs
  * e.g. TCP, IP, HTTP, Skype, Ethernet
  * Protocols define **format, order** of msgs sent and received among network entities, and **actions ** taken on msg transmission and receiption  
  * Internet standards
    * RFC: Request for comments
    * IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force

### 1.1.2 A Services Description

* Distributed applications: Applications involve multiple end systems that exchange data with each other, and run a the end systems.

* Service

  * communication *infrastructure* (and delivery system i.e. protocols) enables distributed applications
    * Web, VoIP, email, games, e-commerce, file sharing
  * communication services provided to apps:
    * Reliable data delivery from source to destination
    * "Best effort" (unreliable) data delivery => some times we prefer loss of bits than speed of transformation(online game/movie)

## 1.2 The network edge

-------------

### 1.2.1 Access Networks

* network edge: applications and hosts 
* Hosts / end systems
  * client
  * server
* access networks(edge router): the network that physically connects an end system to the **first** router 
  * e.g.
    * DSL (digital subscriber line) : A residence typically obtains DSL Internet access from the same local telephone company (telco) that provides its wired local phone access.  
    * Cable, FTTH, Dial-Up and Satellite
  * Properties
    * slower than core
    * dedicated(私有)

----------

### 1.3 The Network Core

#### 1.3.1 Packet switching

* Store-and-Forward Transmission :packet switch must receive the entire packet before it can begin to transmit the first bit of the packet onto the outbound link 
  * Consider : source has three packets, each consist of L bits
  * First buffer the packet's bits : size of packets is L, rate is R
  * transmission(for one packet) delay = (L/R)*number of links
* Queuing Delays and Packet Loss
  * For each link linked to the **output buffer**(output queue)
  * Store the packets to the queue when the output link is busy
  * The queue has finity capacity
  * packet arriving to full queue dropped (aka lost)
  * lost packet may be retransmitted by previous node, by source end system, or not at all
* Forwarding Tables and Routing Protocols
  * IP address of target host is writen in the header of packets by the sender host
  * Forwarding table: Each router has an forward table that maps destination addresses
  * Packets' IP is read by the table to find appropriate outbound link

#### 1.3.2 Circuit Switching

* circuit-switched network : set up a new path between sourse and target

  - dedicated resources: no sharing

  -  circuit-like (guaranteed) performance

  - call setup required

  - dividing link bandwidth into “pieces”

    - frequency-division multiplexing : share channel

      - FM radio stations also use FDM to share the frequency spectrum between 88 MHz and 108 MHz, with each station being allocated a specific frequency band. 

    - Time-division multiplexing(TDM): use whole channel but share on time

      - Frame: time is divided into frames of fixed duration 
      - Slots: each frame is divided into a fixed number of time slots
      - When the network establishes a connection across a link, the network dedicates one time slot in every frame to this connection 
      - transmission rate of a circuit is equal to the frame rate multiplied by the number of bits in a slot (frame per second*number of bits in a slot = slot per second/slot per frame * number of bits)
      - Bit rate: total bits per second
      - transmission rate: for one slot (bit rate/slots per sec)

      $$
      dely\ time=time\ to\ set\ up+{packet\ size\over( {bit\ rate\over slots\ per\ sec})}(total\ slots)
      $$

* Packet Switching Versus Circuit Switching

  * packet-switching: data sent thru net in discrete “chunks” （router决定下一个方向， if busy store into buffer）
    * A, B packets share $\color{red}{network}$ resources
    * each packet uses full link bandwidth
    * resource contention
      * aggregate resource demand can exceed amount available
      * congestion: packets queue, wait for link use
      * store and forward: packets move one hop at a time
      * Node receives complete packet before forwarding
  * Statistical multiplexing
    - Sequence of A & B packets does not have fixed pattern, bandwidth shared on demand => statistical multiplexing
    - each host gets same slot in revolving TDM frame
  * transmit delay : (num of edges*size of file)/deliver rate
  * packet switching > circuit switching
    - Great for bursty(Discrete) data
      - resource sharing
      - Simpler, no call setup
    - excessive congestion: packet delay and loss
      - protocols needed for reliable data transfer, congestion control
    - How to provide circuit-like behaviour
      - bandwidth guarantees needed for audio/video apps (pay for the service)

* network core: 
  * interconnected **routers**
  * network of networks

### 1.4 Delay, Loss, and Throughput in Packet-Switched Networks

* Four sources of delay

  - Nodal processing : check bit errors and determine output link （negligible 可忽略）

  - Queueing : time waiting at output for transmission and depends on congestion level of router  (not negligible)

  - Transmission delay : L(file size)/R(rate) (negligible)

  - Propagation delay : down voteaccepted (negligible)

    Propagation delay is how long it takes *one* bit to *travel* from one end of the "wire" to the other (it's proportional to the length of the wire, crudely).

    Transmission delay is how long it takes to get *all* the bits *into* the wire in the first place (it's packet_length/data_rate).
    $$
    d_{nodal}=d_{proc}+d_{queue}+d_{trans}+d_{pop} 
    $$

  - Throughput

    - Throughput: rate(bits/time unit) at which bits transfeered between sender/receiver (observe from receiver side)
      - Instantaneous : At any instant of time is the rate(bits/sec) at which Host B is receiving the file
      - Average : 平均速度 F(whole bits)/T(whole time)
      - Consider $R_S$ is the rate of link between server and router $R_c$ denote the rate of the link between client and router, then the transmission rate is min($R_S$,$R_c$)
      - Per-connection end-end throughput: min($R_S$,$,R_c$, R/10)
      - in practice: $R_S$ and $R_c$ is oftehn bottleneck

  ### 1.5 Protocol Layers and Their Service Models

  * Layer : each layer implements a service

    * via its own internal-layer actions
    * relying on services provided by layer below (down to top)

  * Internet protocol stack

    * Application : supporting network applications
      * FTP, SMTP, HTTP
    * Transport : processing data and transfer
      * TCP, UDP
    * Network : routing of datagrams from source to destination (for router decide output link)
      * IP, routing protocols
    * Link : data transfer between neighboring network elements (avoid collision, generate different number)
      * PPP, Ethernet
    * Physical : bits "on the wire" (from bits to signal)

  * ISO/OSI reference model (2 layers between application and transport) => do have this in the history

    * presentation : allow applications to interpret meaning of data (encryption, compression, machine-specific conventions)
    * Session : synchoronization, checkpointing, recovery of data exchange

    ![](layer.png)

  * The graph of layers

    * Only destination delete header, only source add header , only this two have 5 layers
    * switch only has 2 layers, routers only have 3 layers

* For long-term steady rate transmission Circuit switching  is better

* Skype offers a function to have phone call between computers and phones (connect computer network with telephone network) How?

   Skype app $\Leftarrow$ Packet switching (Internet (packets))$\Rightarrow$ Gateway $\Leftarrow$ Circuit switching(Telephone net (stream)) $\Rightarrow$ Phone

* How long does it take a packet of length 2000 bytes to ==propagate== over a link of distance 2000 km, propagation speed $2*10^8 m/s$, and transmission rate 2Mbps(it is **bits**)?

  * Transmission delay : time spend for **push data to link**

  * Propogation delay : time spend **on the link**
    $$
    td = {L\over R} = {2000*8\over 2*10^6} = 0.008s
    $$

    $$
    pd={2*10^6\over 2*10^8}=0.01s
    $$

    

* Suppose that users share a 10Mbps link, i.e., they all send traffic to a node which has a 10Mbps link to forward the traffic received from the users. Suppose that each user transmits continuously at 5Mbps when transmitting, but each user transmits only 20% of the time.  

  * When circuit switching is used, how many users can be supported? => 2

  * Suppose that there are **4** users and packet switching is used. What is the fraction of time that the queue at the node is not empty? 
    $$
    p=C_4^3*0.2^3*0.8+C_4^4*0.2^4

### 2.1 Principles of Network Applications 

* creating an internet app

  * program on different ending systems
* Application architecher

  * p2p (pear to pear)
  * Client - Server
    * Server
      * always on host
      * permanent IP address (not local IP address)
      * data centers for scaling
    * Client
      * call communication first
      * may be intermittently(间隔) connected
      * may have dynamic IP addresses
      * do not communicate directly with each other
* P2P

  * no always-on server (everyone service each other)
  * arbitary ending systems directly connected
  * peers are intermittently connected and change IP addresses
    * complex management
* Process communicating

  * Process : program running within a host (ending systems)
    * with the same host, two processed using $\color {red}{interprocess\ communcation}$ (defined by *OS*)
    * processes in different hosts communicate by exchanging messages
* Address processes : for client to match message returned and process or server to match process and coming message

  * Unique IP address for identifying client
  * *identifiers* includes both **IP address** and **port numbers**
* types of messages exchanged, 

  * e.g., request, response 
  * message syntax:
    * what fields in messages & how fields are delineated
  * message semantics 
    * meaning of information in fields
  * rules for when and how processes send & respond to messages
    * HTTP, DNS，Skype 
* Web overview
  * Web and HTTP
    * web page consist of referenced objects which are based on *HTML* file
    * Each object is addressed by a URL
  * HTTP: Web's application layer protocol
    * Client : browser (using HTTP protocol and "displays" web objects)
    * server: Web server sends (using HTTP protocol) objects in response to requests 
    * HTTP based on TCP : 
      * client initiates connection
      * Server accepts TCP connection from client
      * HTTP messages (application-layer protocol messages) exchanged between browser (HTTP client) and Web server (HTTP server)
      * TCP connection is closed
  * HTTP connections
    * Non-persistent connection
      * at most one object sent over a TCP connection
        * The connection is then closed
      * downloading multiple objects required multiple connections
        * If we do not consider the transmission time, it takes two round trip time (i.e. from client to server then back to client) (RTT) to get each object (one for object, one for close TCP link request)
        * HTML : 2 RTT Object : 2 RTT
    * Persist HTTP : Multiple objects can be sent over a single TCP connection between client and server
      * without pipelining
        * Client issues new request only when the previous one has been received
        * HTML : 2 RTT Each Object : 1 RTT
      * with pipelining
        * Client issues new request as soon as it encounters a reference object
        * As little as 1 RTT for all the referenced objects (send all objects at the same time)
* HTTP Headers

  * General header
  * Request/Response header
    * Request method : post(send message to server) , get(get data from server) , head, put, delete, option(what kind of method HTTP supply)
    * Response header
      * Status-line
        * HTTP version number 
        * Status code (indicating success or failure) (200 OK, 404 Not Found)
        * Status phrase
      * General/Response/Entity Header (s)
        * Date
        * Last-Modified
        * Content-Length
  * Entity header (property of content)
* Cookies

  * small chunck of data generated by Web server and stored on computer's hard disk
    * Fix problems caused by HTTP's stateless(server doesn't remember the information of client) protocol
    *
