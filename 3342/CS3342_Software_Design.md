### What is Software

* Software is a set of items or objects that form a “configuration” that includes 
  * **programs** (i.e., source code, executable code) which are instructions
  * **documents** (requirements, design document, test plan, user guide, etc.) ‘describe the program’
  * **data structure** that ‘enable program’ to work. 
* Software is the Product that SW engineers design and build
  * produces, manages, acquires, modifies, displays, or transmits information
* Software is logical rather than physical
* Software is a vehichle for delivering a product/service
  * Supports or directly provides system functionality (e.g., banking system, inventory control, CRM)
  * Controls other programs (e.g., an operating system)
  * Enable communications (e.g., networking software)
  * Helps build other software (e.g., software tools)
* **The IEEE Definition of Software Engineering**
  * “The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software; that is, the application of engineering to software.”
* **Why do software project fail**
