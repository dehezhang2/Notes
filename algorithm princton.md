### merge sort and quick sort

#### Interview questions 
1. Merging with smaller auxiliary array. Suppose that the subarray \mathtt{a[0]}a[0] to \mathtt{a[n-1]}a[n−1] is sorted and the subarray \mathtt{a[n]}a[n] to \mathtt{a[2*n-1]}a[2∗n−1] is sorted. How can you merge the two subarrays so that \mathtt{a[0]}a[0] to \mathtt{a[2*n-1]}a[2∗n−1] is sorted using an auxiliary array of length nn (instead of 2n2n)?

		copy only the left half into the auxiliary array
2. Shuffling a linked list

		design a linear-time subroutine that can take two uniformly shuffled linked lists of sizes n1 and n2 and combined them into a uniformly shuffled linked lists of size n1 + n2

#### Assignment3: Patter Recognition

> Computer vision: 
> Computer vision involves analyzing patterns in visual images and reconstructing the real-world objects that produced them. The process is often broken up into two phases: feature detection and pattern recognition. Feature detection involves selecting important features of the image; pattern recognition involves discovering patterns in the features. We will investigate a particularly clean pattern recognition problem involving points and line segments. This kind of pattern recognition arises in many other applications such as statistical data analysis.
